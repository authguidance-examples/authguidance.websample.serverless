TODO
----
1. Get logging working to a basic level, where 400 and 500 errors are captured
   getCompanyTransactions not handling company=3 or company=5 errors

1a. Move OAuth policy writing to a separate file

2. Monitor packaging file sizes and record file sizes for feature v master branch

3. Why do I need module=commonjs in tsconfig and is this the most standard option?
   Can I use ts-node somehow?
   https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/create/templates/aws-nodejs-typescript

4. Get launch.json TypeScript debugging working, with an option for each of the 4 operations
   
5. Look into webpack with source maps - including watch
   Improve imports so that I get small file sizes
   Exclude source maps from upload packages via development and production modes

6. Redeploy to AWS and merge
   API has been renamed to sampleapi so run sls remove on the old basicapi branch first
   Then merge to master and update to node 10

7. Fill in all logging fields
   Use only console logging, which will be simplified due to no child entry for authorizer
   
8. Refine other API solutions based on results

9. Cloud blog write ups to revamp
