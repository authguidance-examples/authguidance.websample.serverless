0. Redeploy to AWS and merge
   API has been renamed to sampleapi so run sls remove on the old basicapi branch first
   Then merge to master and update to node 10

1. Get launch.json TypeScript debugging working, with an option for each of the 4 operations
   DefaultClientError 401 to move to OAuth framework

1. See if I can set these logging fields in AWS:
   requestVerb, resourceId, requestPath, hostName

2. Reduce package file sizes, which are currently:
   sample:     1296 KB
   authorizer: 3530 KB

3. Why do I need module=commonjs in tsconfig and is this the most standard option?
   Can I use ts-node somehow?

5. Look into webpack with source maps - including watch
   Improve imports so that I get small file sizes
   Exclude source maps from upload packages via development and production modes


7. Fill in all logging fields
   Use only console logging, which will be simplified due to no child entry for authorizer
   
8. Refine other API solutions based on results

9. Cloud blog write ups to revamp
