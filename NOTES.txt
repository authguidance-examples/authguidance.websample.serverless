TODO
----
1. Get packaging working and look at file sizes compared to old branch

2. Set up launch.json debugging with 4 options

3. Gradually update classes from main node sample - direct copies as much as possible
   getCompanyTransactions not handling company=3 or company=5 errors
   Get logging working to a basic level, to include 400 and 500 errors

4. Redeploy to AWS
   API has been renamed to sampleapi so run sls remove on the old basicapi branch first
   Then merge to master

5. Fill in all logging fields
   Use only console logging, which will be simplified due to no child entry for authorizer

6. Why do I need module=commonjs in tsconfig and is this the most standard option?
   Can I use ts-node somehow?
