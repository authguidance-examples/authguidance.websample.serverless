TODO
----
1. Get AWS working
   API has been renamed to sampleapi so run sls remove on old then new then redeploy new to /api
   Then merge to master
   Current problems:
   * Wrap the PolicyDocument in an unambiguous type
   * Try bind instead of rebind

2. Get launch.json TypeScript debugging working, with an option for each of the 4 operations
   DefaultClientError 401 to move to OAuth framework

3. Reduce package file sizes, which are currently:
   * sample:     1296 KB
   * authorizer: 3530 KB

   Look into webpack with source maps - including watch
   Improve imports so that I get small file sizes
   Exclude source maps from upload packages via development and production modes

   Why do I need module=commonjs in tsconfig and is this the most standard option?
   Can I use ts-node somehow?

4. See if I can set these logging fields in AWS:
   requestVerb, resourceId, requestPath, hostName
   
5. Cloud blog write ups to revamp
