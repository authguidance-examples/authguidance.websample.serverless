TODO
----
1. Get packaging working and get file sizes similar to master branch
   Record file sizes here for both old and new

2. Gradually update classes from main node sample - direct copies as much as possible
   getCompanyTransactions not handling company=3 or company=5 errors
   Get logging working to a basic level, and including 400 and 500 errors

3. Redeploy to AWS
   API has been renamed to sampleapi so run sls remove on the old basicapi branch first
   Then merge to master
   Update to node 10

4. Set up launch.json debugging with 4 options
   Possibly use webpack with source maps - but exclude source maps from upload packages
   Maybe use separate webpack production and development modes

5. Fill in all logging fields
   Use only console logging, which will be simplified due to no child entry for authorizer

6. Why do I need module=commonjs in tsconfig and is this the most standard option?
   Can I use ts-node somehow?
