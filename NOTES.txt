TODO
----
1. Set up launch.json debugging with 4 options

2. Gradually update classes from main node sample - direct copies as much as possible
   API and OAuth frameworks have a src folder and a package.json file
   getCompanyTransactions not handling company=3 or company=5 errors

3. Fill in all logging fields
   Use only console logging, which will be simplified due to no child entry for authorizer

4. Get packaging working
   Add a package.json to the deployment folder so that API dependencies are expressed cleanly

5. Why do async I need module=commonjs and is this the most standard option?
   Can I use ts-node somehow?
