TODO
----
1. getCompanyTransactions and getUserClaims to complete
   Use better named test json files

2. Set up launch.json debugging with 4 options

3. Gradually update classes from main node sample - direct copies as much as possible
   Each framework should have a src folder and a package.json file
   Base framework requires inversify

4. Fill in all logging fields
   Use only console logging, which will be simplified due to no child entry for authorizer

5. Get packaging working
   Use a deployment project root folder so that API dependencies are simplified

6. Support file logging from a developer PC and shipping via FileBeat
   Use winston for logging and add dependencies
